## Abstracts


### “Computational exact linear algebra: from theory to practice” (Clément Pernet)

Exact linear algebra is a core component of many symbolic and algebraic computations, as it often
delivers competitive theoretical complexities and also better harnesses the efficiency of modern
computing infrastructures. We will present an overview on the recent advances in exact linear
algebra algorithmic and implementation techniques, and highlight the few key ideas that have proven
successful in their design. After considering the choice of the low level computer arithmetic, we
will illutsrate how algorithmic reductions designed for theoretical complexity improvements become
also relevant for efficiency in practice. Laslty, we will give a special care to the design and
implementation of parallel exact linear algebra routines, trying to emphasize the similarities and
distinctness with parallel numerical linear algebra. We aim to provide the working computer
algebraist with a set of best practices for the use or the design of exact linear algebra software.
