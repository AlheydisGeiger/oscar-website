## Program
* Start: Monday, November 26, at noon
* Finish: Friday, November 30, at noon

### Explanations

* Two initial talks (of 30 minutes each) serve as *food for thought*, with suggestions for our long-term goals. Focus on usability and user perspective.
* A *task force* is a small group formed to work on one particular issue.
  + About three or four task forces work in parallel.
  + Each task force decides how they want to work (discussing, coding, ...).
  + At the end of each block a task force produces a (very short) informal protocol to describe the progress (or the lack of it).
  + Task forces can regroup at the beginning of each block.
  + It is intended that all corner stone systems are represented in each task force.
* The *status reports* are 15--20 minutes each.  Focus on mathematics and the user perspective. Leave out technical details here; instead form task force if necessary.
* The schedule for Thursday and Friday will be set during the general discussion on Wednesday.
