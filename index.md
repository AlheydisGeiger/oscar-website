OSCAR is a new computer algebra system being developed by TU
Kaiserslautern, RWTH Aachen, Universit√§t des Saarlandes, TU Berlin,
the University of Siegen, and other collaborators, under the TRR 195
programme, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

OSCAR aims to create a "visionary new" computer algebra system, built on four existing,
Open Source, cornerstone systems:

  * [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) - computational discrete algebra
  * [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/) - commutative and non-commutative algebra, algebraic geometry
  * [Polymake](https://polymake.org/doku.php) - polyhedral geometry
  * Antic ([Hecke](https://github.com/thofma/Hecke.jl/), [Nemo](http://nemocas.org)) - number theory

The aim of the project is to facilitate complex, interdisciplinary computations
requiring a high level of integration between existing computer algebra tools.

For more information about OSCAR, see the [About]({{ site.baseurl}}/about) page.

## Getting started

If you want to see examples of what OSCAR looks like, click on the examples on the
[Examples page]({{ site.baseurl }}/example). These open pre-rendered notebooks that showcase selected things
OSCAR can already do.

If you want to try OSCAR live from your browser, click on the [binder](https://mybinder.org) links on the
[Examples page]({{ site.baseurl }}/example). At present, these will take a few minutes to load, as we currently still
build some dependencies from source behind the scenes.

If you wish to contribute to OSCAR, see the [Installation page]({{site.baseurl}}/install) for
instructions on how to build everything on a growing number of supported platforms.

Note that OSCAR has not reached a first public release yet, and should be treated as
a technology preview. See the [News page]({{site.baseurl}}/news) for announcements about OSCAR development.
