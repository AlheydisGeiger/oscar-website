### WELCOME TO THE WEBSITE OF THE OSCAR PROJECT

OSCAR is a new computer algebra system being developed by TU Kaiserslautern,
RWTH Aachen, Universit√§t Des Saarlandes and other collaborators, under
the TRR 195 programme, funded by the Deutsche Forshungsgemeinschaft.

OSCAR aims to create a "visionary new" computer algebra system, built on four existing,
Open Source, cornerstone systems:

  * [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) - computational discrete algebra
  * [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/) - commutative and non-commutative algebra, algebraic geometry
  * [Polymake](https://polymake.org/doku.php) - polyhedral geometry
  * Antic ([Hecke](https://github.com/thofma/Hecke.jl/), [Nemo](http://nemocas.org)) - number theory

The aim of the project is to facilitate complex, interdisciplinary computations
requiring a high level of integration between existing computer algebra tools.

For more information about OSCAR, see the About page.

## Getting started

If you want to see examples of what OSCAR looks like, click on the examples on the
Examples page. These open prerendered notebooks that showcase selected things
OSCAR can already do.

If you want to try OSCAR live from your browser, click on the binder links on the
Examples page. At present, these will take a few minutes to load, as we currently still
build some dependencies from source behind the scenes.

If you wish to contribute to OSCAR, see the Installation page for
instructions on how to build everything on a growing number of supported platforms.

Note that OSCAR has not reached a first public release yet, and should be treated as
a technology preview. See the News page for announcements about OSCAR development.
